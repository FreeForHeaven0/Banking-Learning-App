📱 Banking Education Sandbox App for Older Adults

A gamified, simulation-based mobile banking education application designed to help older adults safely learn and practice essential digital banking skills.

🧠 Overview

This project is a mobile banking education sandbox created specifically for older adults (50+) who experience difficulty or anxiety when using mobile banking applications.

The app provides a risk-free learning environment where users can explore banking concepts, practice transactions, and build confidence through guided simulations and real-life inspired scenarios.

⚠️ This application does not connect to real bank accounts and does not use real money.

👥 Target Audience

Adults aged 50 and above

Users with low to moderate digital literacy

Individuals hesitant to use mobile banking due to fear of mistakes or security concerns

🎯 Educational Objectives

Improve understanding of core banking concepts (IBAN, EFT, FAST, transfers)

Enable users to practice mobile banking transactions safely

Reduce fear of making mistakes through guided simulations

Increase financial self-confidence and independence

Support digital inclusion and fraud awareness

🧩 Learning Structure

The application follows a level-based, micro-learning model, inspired by gamified learning platforms.

Level 1 – Concept Learning

Users are introduced to essential banking terminology and interface elements through visual learning screens.

Topics covered:

What is an IBAN?

Differences between Transfer, EFT, and FAST

Basic mobile banking interface components

Users must complete a short quiz with at least 75% accuracy to unlock the next level.

Level 2 – Simulation Practice

Users interact with a mock banking interface that simulates real banking operations.

Activities include:

Locating an IBAN in an account screen

Sending money using guided steps

Completing a short simulation-based quiz

Mistakes are allowed and explained with immediate feedback.

Level 3 – Scenario-Based Learning

Users solve realistic, everyday banking scenarios such as:

Sending allowance money to a grandchild

Choosing the correct transfer method for a given situation

This level emphasizes decision-making and applying learned knowledge in context.
